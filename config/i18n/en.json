It is important to us that this project revolves around being open and accessible to anyone who wants to be a part of it. As a strong group we wanna make an environment that is cooperative rather than competitiveâ€”within and outside of the Friendly Sea Creatures. So that we can make the best of all the possibilities NEAR is offering.\n\nWe will be the only source of information you need to stay up to date with everything going on in the NEAR NFT space. Our website NEAR Ocean will provide you with all relevant notifications to be on time for everything you want.",
